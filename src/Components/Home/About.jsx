                <p>
                On March 25th, 2024, I found myself in a situation that underscored the importance of reliable access to analysis resources. 
                As someone who enjoys assisting my colleagues with their model analysis, I created a detailed guideline video for a friend's CFD analysis project and sent it to her via email. However, due to storage constraints on my end, I had to delete the video and analysis data from my computer.
                A month later, the email files had also expired. When my friend needed the project guidelines and video again, it was too late. She also asked me to explain the meaning behind the results derived from the CFD analysis. This experience highlighted the crucial need for reliable access to accurate FEA/CFD analysis processes anytime tailored to specific FEA/CFD projects,
                along with clear interpretation of outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This led to the creation of MeanAs â€” an AI-powered platform designed to provide clarity and accuracy before and after your FEA/CFD analysis. MeanAs addresses the exact challenges I faced, ensuring that you never lose access to important analysis guideline data and always have a clear understanding of your pre/post-processing analysis.
